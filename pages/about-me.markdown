**Music**

I'm a classically-trained pianist with a repertoire that spans from Bach to Shostakovich.  Mostly I've been involved in chamber music for the last 15 years, with a focus on the piano trio literature.

Lately, I've resumed my studies on the violin, long abandoned since middle school.  I'm doing this because everyone needs a little honesty and humility in their life.  The violin gives them both to me.

**Medicine**

After completing medical school in 1989, I trained in internal medicine at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland.  I spent two more years there on-staff before joining the staff at the Mayo Clinic. In 2009, I left Mayo to start a boutique software development company focused mainly on mobile healthcare applications.
