Professor Todd Ehle, has given dozens of freely available violin lessons on YouTube.  As an aid to my own memory and for others, I've begun transcribing these lessons.  Please do not use them to profit in any way from Professor Ehle's work; and please do not reproduce this in any way without attribution.  If you are interested in contributing to the work of transcription, please let me know.
