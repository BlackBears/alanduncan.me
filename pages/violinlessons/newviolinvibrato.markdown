Hi folks.  Someone wrote in last week saying that they had a lot of tension in their vibrato and wanted to know if I could help them with it.

I going to try not to rehash my previous vibrato method information; so you can look that up for the basics - the ideas about how the technique works.  But I am going to say that the trick I'm going to show you here will work both with a wrist or hand vibrato (it depends on who you are and what you call it - they're the same thing) and an arm vibrato.  This trick will work with either one of those.

If you are able to hold your violin - you may want to support it (demonstrates right hand on the body) without putting it down, just do this motion (demonstrates wrist vibrato)  Do this so you feel no tension here; then take your second finger and put it down and just let the motion slide it.  If you feel no tension still, but then you feel tension with the finger down on the string, then you know the tension is caused by squeezing of the finger and the opposing thumb and possibly by the side of your first finger pressing into the neck.  That's where it's coming from.  If you can do this motion (demonstrates wrist vibrato in the air) and it's not bothering, then suddenly you put your hand up there and it is, then I think it's a pretty safe bet that you're squeezing; and that gets in the way.

So what can we do to eliminate the squeeze?

##Supporting left hand with the right##

I've given some ideas before; but here's a really simple idea.  You can't use your bow in the exercise at all, because your right hand it going to be busy.  Set your left hand somewhere between the scroll and the body of the instrument.  Take your right hand, come over the top and put two fingers on your thumb.[^1]  And with the right hand thumb you're going to grab the other side of the fingerboard.[^2]  There should be enough room for the left hand to do the oscillation; but you're supporting it with the thumb.  Then take your second finger (that's the easiest) and try your vibrato motion.  I won't go through all the steps, because I've already done that in other videos.  But just try the motion and see if it feels incredibly relaxed.  Now, if it does, take it (the right hand) off.  Can you still do the motion?  You're going to feel the burden, because it's harder. And you might say: "Now I can't do it because I'm holding my violin."  However, I think that this shows you something.  First of all, it frees up that hand an you can learn the motion.  Or get really comfortable with what it feels like to be completely relaxed.  Then, think about your thumb.  If you support underneath a little bit the shelf (shows left thumb) - making a letter "V" shape.[^3]  Now practice sliding it.  Then put your finger down and vibrate.  Not clutching, squeezing or grabbing.  You can't do this motion (vibrato) if you're squeezing.  It's just impossible.  

So hopefully, that simple little trick will give you the idea of how to feel relaxed.  Then you can go back and recreate that.  Even if it's only for a moment. If you can get it for a moment and you experience it then you can say: "I know what it is that I'm trying to achieve!"  And every time you feel tension, stop.  Maybe do the trick.  Then try the vibrato again.  You may have to do it over and over again; that's OK.  It never happens instantly; but at least now you have an awareness of where you are trying to go.

I hope that helps some of you.  Good luck; and we'll talk later.
