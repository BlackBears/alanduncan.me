Today we're going to talk about tone.

Perhaps you've already been playing in Book 1 and your teacher is discussing the sound you're creating and saying you need more sound.  In Suzuki books there's something called "tonalization"; and Suzuki made up that word (I think he got it from "vocalization"; and he created this to be a tone study.)  So if you use those books, memorize the tonalizations and only concentrate on points that would create a better tone.

The first thing I'm going to say is that this one - what I'm going to discuss - is for a medium bow weight and medium bow speed.  There are many different ways to do this.  If you're out over the fingerboard it would take a lot of speed.  Near the bridge - very slow and heavy, right?  Now we're talking about bowing halfway between the fingerboard and the bridge and a medium amount of bow and bow weight.  

**Backwards bow**
Perhaps you've already seen the exercise where you hold the bow upside down or backwards, where your tip is now the frog.  And the tip is point toward the floor.  The reason you would do this is to let the weight of the [actual] frog pull the bow into the string.  That way you don't have to do the work.  But once you turn the bow around, of course, you have to create that.

**Flicking the bow**

I had a really great violin teacher who was one of my best; and his name is Richard Fuchs.  He teaches at the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley.  He's still there; if you're in that area, look him up.  Anyway, he used to come up behind us while we were playing and flip the tip upward [Demonstrates] and see if the bow went right back to the string, or if, when he flipped it, it popped right out.  What he was trying to prove to us was whether or not we were playing into the string.  So, how do you get _"into the string"_?

**Three ships metaphor for playing into the string**
I'm going to use imagery here; I want you to think of three different boats out on the water.  One is a supertanker; it's very heavy and is very low in the water.  Another is a medium-sized, medium weight boat. It's into the water, certainly not on top of it; but it's not like the supertanker.  The last would be just a little WaveRunner, or Jet Ski, or a small sailboat where it just bounces on top of the water.  Now, for the bow stroke I'm talking about which would be medium weight and speed right between the bridge and fingerboard, we do not want to be just floating on top of the water like the WaveRunner.  Otherwise, we get this airy quality.  And we do not want to be the supertanker which is deep deep into the water or we crush the sound.  So how do you get the medium sound?  Tip the bow toward the scroll, roll it back about half-way and keep that weight into the stick; so that it does not change from that point.  I imagine for a moment that you are painting a fence with a paint brush.  You dip your brush in the bucket of paint and you start painting.  I don't want your paintbrush hairs to leave the fence when you get to the end and turn your brush around. Keep the brush on the fence as you turn it around.  It's the same principle here.  You're not going to let the weight out at either end before you turn it around.  You're going to keep the bow weight into the string and just turn it around.

So what's happening in the bow hand to make this happen?  I feel a little pressure in the thumb and the first finger is going to oppose it.  Imagine you're holding a large glass of water and you're going to pour it down the drain.  That rotation is what causes the stick to go into the string.  Once you can do that, keeping it into the string, then you must stare at your contact point as I've discussed in one of my other videos.  Does your bow slide? If you can keep it in one spot, keeping the same amount of weight in the bow so that it does not come out at each end.  It doesn't mean that it does not come off the string.  Of course, it doesn't come off the string; but you could let weight out and keep the hair in contact with the string.  You must keep it all the same for now.  And listen to see if the sound changes as you turn the bow around.  Do you have a moment of weightlessness?  Imagine your driving in a car and you hit a speedbump.  Does you car come off the street?  No; but does it kind-of go up?  Yes, that's what we don't want at the bow change before we turn around?  No speedbump.  Keep it __in__ and just turn around.

Again, right now, here [points to halfway point betwee fingerboard and bridge].  Medium "boat" weight.  Thumb is up a little bit.  First finger is down a little bit.  And you just stay in one spot.  And don't slide.  And listen to your tone.

Good luck.
