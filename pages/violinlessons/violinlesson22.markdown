title:  Violin Lesson #22:  Vibrato (hand/wrist)

_(Note: This is a transcription of an online violin lesson given by expert teacher Todd Ehle.  I've transcribed it here as a memory aid for myself and a service to others.  Please do not use this in any way to profit from Mr. Ehle's work.  The [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zraCMnfqTso&list=PL2266F2353CEA4A34) for this lesson is available on YouTube.)_

I'd like to make a couple of new videos for you. They'll be about vibrato; and they'll be covering the same information I've give you before. But I'll try to make it succinct - one video about wrist vibrato (also called hand vibrato) and one video about arm vibrato.  So, it's not new information; but hopefully it will be easier to follow.  And I'll try to talk less!

Watch my forearm for a minute.[^1]  (Plays note with wrist vibrato)  You see, the forearm stays still and the hand is oscillating on top of a still arm.  So that is a hand vibrato.
