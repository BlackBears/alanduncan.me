Today I'm going to be talking about relaxation techniques while you're playing.

I had a teacher say to me once that the only way to play the violin was to be thoroughly relaxed so that you could do what you knew how to do even under tremendous pressure.  Meaning, your mind could be screaming because of fear, or stage fright, or anxiety, but your body must be completely loose.  [It's] an incredibly difficult thing to do.  So I'm going to give you a couple of ideas.  We all get nervous.  Isaac Stern said that only fools and children do not get nervous.  I hate to plant that in your mind now in case you're young; but you need to know that it is very difficult to play in front of others once you feel like your self-worth or your respect is at stake.  So I will always say be 100% prepared, before a performance, trying to acquire 80% in front of the crowd.  It's very difficult to play in front of an audience and get 100%.  But anyway, if you're you're relaxed, you have a better chance.

So, we have _"squeeze points"_ with the violin. I call them _"squeeze points"_ - places where you could hold tension:

- bow hand
- the head and shoulder combination
- the left hand, thumb and finger combination (where they oppose each other and can squeeze down)

You must think about those spots as being problematic. I'm going to give you a couple of ideas:

**Stance**

- The first one is your __stance__.  Actually, I played a recital once; and when I go done, the next morning my hamstring hurt in the back of my leg.  I had held tension in my leg during my recital to the point that it was sore the next day.  So remember: get your stance, shoulder width, rock side-to-side, feel the balance.  It's incredibly important that you're nice and relaxed.

**Violin hold**

- The next thing is your __violin hold__.  It's on your shoulder and this [the height of the violin + chin rest + shoulder rest] has to fill the gap so that you do not have to raise or lean.  Put the __jaw__ in the chin rest.  And use gravity, the weight of your head - which is tremendously heavy - should be enough to hold the instrument in place.  You turn, you drop, the weight of the head - that's one great exercise - just to feel the head weight fall into the chin rest and the shoulders fall towards the floor, so there's nothing squeezing against each other.  Now, I've noticed with students sometimes their jaw muscles flexing.  So I would like to say to you, keep your teeth open but your lips closed.  If you play with your mouth open, you will look funny.  One my teachers said it looks like you're trying to catch flies.  It will look funny.  And I have seen students who have too big a gap here [between the shoulder and the jaw] try to fill the gap by doing that [opening the mouth] and they weren't aware of it.  It means you need a higher chin rest or a higher shoulder rest.  Something has to fill the gap.  You must keep this [jaw muscles] open; if you create tension here, it will travel down the neck and into the shoulders.  If you are relaxed here [in the jaw] it will help you be relaxed in other places.

**Left hand relaxation**

So we talked about finger flexibility in one of my other videos.  And that will perhaps help no to squeeze here [in the bow hold].  You need to have a firmness.  I've said before that it's like holding a large glass of water.  Imagine how hard you have to squeeze it.  Not too hard; but enough to keep it from falling to the ground.

With the left hand, I knew a teacher who used to make students tap their left thumb.  If they thought they were squeezing.  Clap or tap the thumb to try and keep that from happening.  You can also practice this exercise [a light shifting glissando up and down the fingerboard] to see if you're loose.  If you hear a ratcheting sound it means that you're way too tight.  If you're not shifting yet, maybe you're playing "Chorus" from Judas Maccabeus.  [Plays first few measures.]  What you can do with this, though, is to push the finger to the fingerboard, imagining the fingerboard is made out of rubber, and it's springy and it pushes the finger out a little bit.  This isn't the way you'd actually play; it's just a concept to help you feel relaxation.  [Demonstrates] You're going to get to the contact point on the fingerboard, then you're going to bounce back from the "rubber" fingerboard.  You will not lift your finger off the string - it will still touch the string.  But you will get this effect. [Demonstrates - sounds like note speaking, then diminishing to a non-speaking harmonic] It's not pretty; but that's not what we're going for.  So what I'm feeling is:  I'm in, then I release the tension.  I like to think of using a gauge or a dial; so 10 would be the most and 0 would be least.  And I apply this to many different parts of my teaching.  But if you thought of squeezing the string as a "10", then just turn it down to an "8", then to a "6", then a "4", then a "2".  The fuzzy [non-speaking harmonic] sound] would be about a "2".  You're just touching the string, but the string is not being bent towards the fingerboard. [Demonstrates].  You understand?  Now, you'll go back and play in a regular manner.  But remember how it felt to release the tension?  You're going to release the tension, especially here [the pinky side of the left hand] and in the thumb, to the point where you get that fuzziness.  You won't get it that far; but you're almost there. And it's a very liberating sensation.  You feel free.  You'll be able to play much quicker without risk of injury.

I hope it helps.  Good luck.
