Title: Photography

I'm an off-and-on photographer.  Right now, I'm in an off phase.

**Abandonment**

As a photographer, I have an unnatural predilection for things abandoned, lost, and forgotten because of what it says about us as humans and about the living context in which we find ourselves.  In scenes of abandonment, nature invariably exercises its control over the built environment, first in one small crack, then eventually consuming it in an eerie tableau.  The great photographer, William Eggleston, famously commented: _"I am at war with the obvious."_[^1]

About ourselves, it speaks like the Buddha of our own impermanence.  To meditate on scenes of abandonment opens us to acceptance that we, too, will be overtaken.  To accept abandonment is to accept mortality.

I photographed "Grown up" in 2006 when I returned to a place that I played as a child.  The swimming pool, tennis courts and playground had been long abandoned and left to nature.  The feeling was like a post-apocalyptic moment.  This place had been a swim club in the deep South, an oasis of segretation at a time when public swimming pools were beginning to open to all children.  Not only does has this forgotten place come to symbolize the passing of childhood; but also the passing of a stain on our history.

I photographed _"The ball's in your court"_ at the same place.  
<br />
I was struck by the scene of a weather-beaten chair sitting on the sideline of the right service court as if someone had pulled up a seat to watch a game at some unusual angle.  Or just to imaging what it would be like to sit their during a match, services flying by at unimaginable speed.
<br /><br />
The weather court had begun to exfoliate under the intense southern sun, revealing layers upon layers of resurfacing.  Someone had carefully applied these layers without giving the slightest thought that they would be buried, then revealed again in time by a passer-by, a casual urban archaeologist.
<br /><br />
In each crack, long tufts of ratty grass had taken hold, pushing up more layers of material, widening the clefts, consuming the courts in their wake.
<br /><br />

_"Dream fatigue"_ was an unusual find.  Driving home from work late one winter night, I noticed piles of mattresses discarded in the parking garage of a downtown hotel.  I returned with my camera and tripod to capture the image.
<br /><br />
Had these tired hotel mattresses had enough?  What dreams had they inspired?  For what flights of passion, for what fits of rage, and in what depths of dispair had they lent their final support?
<br /><br />
There is something especially sad about seeing an item of comfort, something very personal, discarded in a public place.  Like a chair put out at the curb in hopes that someone will forget that it bore the weight of another.  To witness a item closely held being let go in this way speaks again to our own impermanence both in the sense of physical lives as a being and in the sense of our impermanent identity.  Our identity in this sense is just a meaningless construct that is created and destroyed with each cycle of the breath.
<br /><br />
Compositionally, I particularly like the random casual angles and the depth of shadow in this photograph.

**Interesting thigs**

I've been fortunate enough to have a [few photographs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/_alan_/sets/72157594423024924/) recognized on flickr when I cared about such things.

I photographed _"Big Brother"_ one summer night in Chicago while wandering around downtown.  It was a playful evening as kids from the surrounding neighborhoods streamed into the park to splash and play in the fountains.
<br /><br />
It was an incredibly lively scene; and it reminded me of how urban spaces, despite their drawbacks, can give their inhabitants opportunities to collide in unexpected places and ways as if by Brownian motion.

The contrast between the stern faces and the oblivious children could not have been more striking.  When I think about that night, I feel a welling-up of anti-authoritarian sentiment coming to the surface.

They don't care what is around the object as long as nothing interferes with the object itself, right in the centre...The blindness is apparent when someone lets slip the word 'snapshot'. Ignorance can always be covered by 'snapshot'. The word has never had any meaning. I am at war with the obvious."_
