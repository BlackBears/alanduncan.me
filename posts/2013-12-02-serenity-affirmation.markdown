As a family member of a person with addiction, I've thought a lot about how AA and Al-Anon work.  Both rely heavily on the 12-steps and the Serenity Prayer, written by Reinhold Niebuhr.  Based on the work of others, I've rewritten the Serenity Prayer as an affirmation to coincide with my own practice.

Here's my version of the Serenity Affirmation:

{% blockquote %}"May my practice give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

May I live one day at a time,
Enjoy one moment at a time, and
Accept life's hardships as a sign of impermanence.
May I live in the world as it is, not as I would have it,
Finding happiness wherever I am."
{% endblockquote %}
