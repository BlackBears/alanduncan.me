Continuing in my series to learn vibrato on the violin, here's another video on my takeways from it.  The video is by Todd Ehle (aka 'professorv' on YouTube).  This is his [lesson #22:  Vibrato techniques (covers hand and wrist)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zraCMnfqTso).

He explains that **wrist vibrato** differs from arm vibrato in that with the former, the hand is oscillating on top of a _still_ arm.  To begin practicing wrist vibrato:

1. Hold the instrument in 'guitar' manner, with the body tucked under the right arm.
2. Take the base of the left thumb and place it against the ribs on the top of the body of the instrument.  (This looks like about 4th or 5th position.)
3. Make sure the hand is in neutral position where it is lined up with the forearm.
4. Ensure that the fingers are all very relaxed.

Begin making gentle oscillations of the hand, extending at the wrist, back toward the scroll.  He mentions that some students tend to begin oscillating from the fingers (the metacarpophalangeal or MCP joints) rather than from the wrist.  The proper oscillation comes from extension at the wrist.  While making these practice oscillations, keep the hand arm still by bracing the hand against the body of the instrument.  This first exercise is done without contacting the string.

In the next exercise, you place the finger on the A string, but only lightly so.  Then just make the same oscillation with the finger sliding on top of the string.

Moving onto the third exercise, you begin to add weight to the finger; but notice that you can't keep the same curvature of the finger as you oscillate backwards because if you did, it would pull the note completely out of tune.  Around 2:15 in the video, Todd explains how the backwards oscillation of the wrist needs to be associated with a transfer of weight from the fingertip down further into the inside the finger by extending the distal interphalangeal joint.  This isn't a purposeful forced extension of the DIP joint; but it follows from the basic wrist motion coupled with a very relaxed DIP.  Finally, he talks about repetitions, where you gradually increase the number and speed of the repeats of this little exercise.

### Beginning exercises with the instrument in playing position ###

The next set of beginning exercises are all done with the instrument in playing position.  Here, the steps and placement of the hand are all the same; we're just holding the instrument in the normal playing position at this stage.  After you're comfortable with these steps just practicing the motion quietly, you can start to play the notes with the bow.  Don't worry about what note it is; and just beginning playing with slow oscillations, gradually speeding up.  He recommends doing the faster bits in **small bursts** in an **upbow**.  It's a complicated explanation why upbow martel√© works here; but basically the quick upsurge of energy in the bow arm gets translated into a similar amount of energy in the left hand.

After that's progressing, you can start to work with other fingers; the next of which would be the second finger, then the first, leaving the fourth to last.

### Starting to work with in first position ###

Until now, all of the exercises have been with the left hand resting against the ribs.  Although this is a great way to support the hand while it's learning to vibrate, we want to learn to do vibrato in other positions, too.  The classic way to do this is to press the scroll against the wall so the instrument is supported.  Another way to learn to do this is to do the motion of the wrist knocking into the E string peg from first position.  Then it's a matter of practicing with bursts of action in a single upbow.
