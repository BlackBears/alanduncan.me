For the last several years, after leaving my medical practice, I've been a full-time iOS and Mac developer.

Increasingly, I feel an uneasiness about my work, especially on mobile devices.  I'm proud of the professionalism and rigor that I bring to my work; but I fret about the consequences of our ubiquitous use of smartphones.  In short, I feel as if I'm part of the problem.

Every time I see a parent "anesthetizing" their child with an iPhone or iPad.  Every time I seem someone texting while driving.  When I see teenagers glued to their phones while tuning out the real world.  When I see parents surfing and not paying attention to their children.

I don't doubt that mobile technology has helped us in many ways.  But I question the net effect.
