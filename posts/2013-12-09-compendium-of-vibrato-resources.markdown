Let me get the caveats out of the way first: I'm a student violinist, not a teacher.  And certainly not an experty by any stretch.  I've written this mainly to get my own sense of clarity about the motions involved in vibrato, exercises to learn vibrato, and other tips from teachers - both my own and on the web.

Vibrato is an expressive technique in music the imparts a richness and character to the tone.  I'm going to focus solely on violin and viola; but vibrato can be applied to any instrument, including the voice.  So, in no particular order, I'm going to start blogging about interesting resources I've found on the subject of violin and viola vibrato, starting with a fascinating video showing slow-motion videography of the vibrato motion.

YouTube: [Violin Vibrato:  Slow motion + Do's and Don't](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8OT7EFKE78)

In this video, starting about 1:35, she shows the motion of wrist vibrato in slow motion on the left, and in real-time on the right.  In slow motion, it's easier to see the degree to which relaxation in the hand and finger joints allows the player to rock the first finger back to far side of the finger tip during the peak of the oscillation.  At 1:47, you can see the motion from above.  To me it's remarkable to note how still the thumb is during this motion.

At 2:00 she points out how students who tend to grasp the neck of the violin between the thumb and first finger sets them up for wasted motion by restricting the first finger from actually rocking back.  So from a distance, there appears to be a satisfactory vibrato; but because there's no motion at the finger pad, or the amplitude is severely restricted, there isn't much audible vibration.  By releasing the first finger from its contact with the neck, the distal interphalangeal joint is able to move, flattening the pad of the fingertip, creating a much more audible vibrato.

Next at 2:51, she takes up the second finger vibrato which she explains is easier in the learning stages because the hand is more balanced with the second finger, then, acting as a fulcrum. In this segment, Beth explains another problem motion that beginners may fall into where the player maintains contact with the neck and the hand and forearm pivot in opposite directions about the wrist.  It's like the wrist is buckling out.  Again, it's a wasted motion.  (And it looks funny!)

The third finger is taken up at 4:29 which she explains is an easier finger to work with while learning because the finger already approaches the string at a more relaxed angle.

### The thumb ###

At around 5:20, Beth talks about the thumb which has an interesting role during vibrato.  If the thumb is too tight, then the motion of the vibrato gets carried down into the instrument, making it move.  It also restricts the actual purposeful motion of the vibrato.  Instead she talks about the soft tissue of the thumb acting as a flexible interface between the neck of the violin and the bony thumb.  But this can only happen if the player isn't exerting pressure on the thumb.  At 5:58, there's a great view of the hand from above in slow-motion showing that there is good flexibility in the joint at the base of the thumb which allows the hand to move more freely.  If the thumb is squeezing, then that joint locks too, inhibiting the purposeful motion.

### Tight vibrato ###

Next, she talks about the situation of a "tight vibrato" (6:53) where there isn't sufficient flexibility in the first joint (the DIP or distal interphalangeal joint).  It creates a narrow vibration.  Too much pressure on the string, creates an inflexibility in the DIP.  So there's a "sweet spot" where there's just enough pressure on the string to allow the note to speak; but not so much that it restricts the flexibility of the DIP.  Not to mention the strain on the hand, difficulties in shifting, and so forth.

### Fourth finger ###

The fourth finger is the most difficult in vibrato for many reasons.  It's the farthest away from the balance point of the hand and it's the weakest of the fingers.  Beth points out at 8:47 the angle of the fourth finger to the string (nearly perpendicular).  In slow motion, the fourth finger vibrato looks almost like a circular motion massaging the string.

### Amplitude of vibrato as a function of dynamics ###

The dynamic and the amplitude need to be closely linked, narrowerer in _piano_ passages, wider in _forte_ passages.  As you sculpt the phrases, the amplitude and speed change to suit the dynamic.

### Continuous vibrato ###

At around 11:50, she talks about continuous vibrato.  Slow motion shots show that the motion is not actually continuous because it's really not possible to multitask in this way.

### Higher positions ###

Most importantly, get the thumb down and around the neck to give enough space to move the hand.
